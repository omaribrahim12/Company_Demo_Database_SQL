This is a basic company database system using different tables and applying some queries and functions for clear understanding 


I used phpmyadmin to build the system you can easiley download it from the following link 

https://www.phpmyadmin.net/downloads/

and then start with CreatingTables.sql to initially create the tables after you can apply any functions or queries. 

Feel free to download or fork it!
